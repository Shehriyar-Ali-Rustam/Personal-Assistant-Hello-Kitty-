## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Speech Recognition:
```python
energy_threshold = 300  # More sensitive
pause_threshold = 0.6   # Faster response
dynamic_threshold = True  # Auto-adjusts
```

### AI Configuration:
```python
max_tokens = 100  # Shorter, faster responses
temperature = 0.7  # More focused
generation_config = optimized  # Faster generation
```

### Wake Word:
```python
calibration = 1s  # Was 2s (50% faster startup)
sensitivity = increased  # Better detection
```

## 📈 Expected User Experience

### Before:
```
You: "Hello Kitty"
[wait 2-3 seconds]
